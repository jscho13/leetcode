OPTIMIZE
6. bst-checker - current solution is O(n^2), do one in O(n)
5. graph-coloring - current solution is O(N*D), find O(N+M)
largest-stack - the solution you did has O(n) push and pop. there's an O(1) solution
queue-two-stacks - came up with a O(n^2) solution. Find the O(n) solution
linked-list-cycles - lesson learned: a dictionary is S(n) space. The lookup is O(1), but it still takes up S(n) space.
nth-fib - O(n) and S(n). There is O(n) and S(1).
mesh-message - calculated O(n+M) incorrectly
6. cake-thief - came up with O(n^2) S(n). there is O(n*m) S(k)

NOTES
Binary search:

When going through the list there's extra if/else logic for the first and last element
It's way cleaner to do a while loop.

function binarySearch() {
  // set stuff here

  while (leftIndex < rightIndex) {
    // move the leftIndex up or rightIndex down accordingly

    if (leftIndex+1 === rightIndex) {
      // you know you're at the end of the list so get out of the loop
      break;
    }
  }

  return rightIndex;
}


BST:
// Assume we have an efficient queue implementation, Queue()
// with enqueue and dequeue methods and a size property

function bfs(graph, startNode, endNode) {

  const nodesToVisit = new Queue();
  nodesToVisit.enqueue(startNode);

  // Keep track of what nodes we've already seen
  // so we don't process them twice
  const nodesAlreadySeen = new Set([startNode]);

  while (nodesToVisit.size > 0) {
    const currentNode = nodesToVisit.dequeue();

    // Stop when we reach the end node
    if (currentNode === endNode) {

      // Found it!
      break;
    }

    graph[currentNode].forEach(neighbor => {
      if (!nodesAlreadySeen.has(neighbor)) {
        nodesAlreadySeen.add(neighbor);
        nodesToVisit.enqueue(neighbor);
      }
    });
  }
}
