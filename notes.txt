Binary search:

When going through the list there's extra if/else logic for the first and last element
It's way cleaner to do a while loop.

function binarySearch() {
  // set stuff here

  while (leftIndex < rightIndex) {
    // move the leftIndex up or rightIndex down accordingly

    if (leftIndex+1 === rightIndex) {
      // you know you're at the end of the list so get out of the loop
      break;
    }
  }

  return rightIndex;
}
