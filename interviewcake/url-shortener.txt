data model
link -> short url, long url
insert and make sure there are no collisions
n^62 availabe characters... like some 5 trillion
nosql is flatter, sql probably isn't a good choice here
read faster by putting more in memory
LRU cache or sharding (split by key)
adding a cache will add more complexity. you need to keep the db and cache in sync
db's will also need to handle multiple connections. but all of them come with that by default
load balancer to split among multiple front end workers
