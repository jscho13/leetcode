These were so bad you need to do them all over again:
highest-product-of-3
find-repeat-space-edition

Optimize these since the breakdown reading made you realized yours is garbage:
bst-checker - current solution is O(n^2), do one in O(n)
graph-coloring - current solution is O(N*D), find O(N+M)
largest-stack - the solution you did has O(n) push and pop. there's an O(1) solution
queue-two-stacks - came up with a O(n^2) solution. Find the O(n) solution

Best solution, but could be heavily refactored:
bracket-validator
