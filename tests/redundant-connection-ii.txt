Adjacency matrix:
blazing fast lookup since its a giant dictionary
takes up 2n space

   1 2 3 4 5 6
   -----------
1| 0 1 0 0 1 0
2| 0 0 1 0 0 0
3| 0 0 0 1 0 0
4| 1 0 0 0 0 0
5| 0 0 0 0 0 0
6| 1 0 0 0 0 0
empty row = no children
empty column = no parents
[4,1] is answer


Adjacency list:
takes up little space
but its slower for lookups
1  [4]
2  [1]
3  [2]
4  [3]
5  [1]
S  Eparents

1  [2,3,4]
2  [0]
3  [2]
4  [5]
5  [0]
S  Echildren

Assume valid input
If there wasnt... you need a recurisve method that checks if all nodes are connected
The only way theres a redudant connection is if theres two in the adjacency list
Find all the ones with 2+, search through the edge list backwards
