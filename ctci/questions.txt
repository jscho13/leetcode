2. Write a method to sort an array of strings such that all the anagrams are next to each other
3. Given a sorted array of n integers that have been rotated an unknown number of times, write code to find an element in the array. You may assume that the array was originally sorted in increasing order.
e.g. find 5 in (15, 16, 19, 20, 25, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 14)
output 8 (index 5 of in the array)
