//Given a sorted array of n integers that have been rotated an unknown number of times, write code to find an element in the array. You may assume that the array was originally sorted in increasing order.
// e.g. find index of 5th item in the unsorted array in (15, 16, 19, 20, 25, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 14)
// output 8
